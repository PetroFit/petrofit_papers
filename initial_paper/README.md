# Paper Resources
**PetroFit:  A Python Package for ComputingPetrosian Radii and Fitting Galaxy Light Profiles**

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that were used to create plots and run benchmark tests. It is currently being re-organized to match the sections of the paper which will make navigating the material easier (file names, folders etc...). For transparency, we have uploaded all materials used to generate figures and tables in the initial paper.

## Environment
The packages needed for the notebooks in these resources are stored in `environment.yml`. The following command can be used to install the environment in a conda env:

``conda env create -f environment.yml``

This command should create a new environment called ``petrofit``.
