# PetroFit Papers 

This repo stores scripts used for papers related to PetroFit and its development. 
Please see the README in each folder (if on GitHub, you can click on the folder and scroll down).
Each folder should also have a conda environment file if there are scripts or notebooks.
Lastly if this repo gets too large in the future, we may have to squash its git history.
